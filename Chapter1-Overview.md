## Public cloud Services: 
   - Compute resources
   - Storage
   - Networking
   - Specialized services suas ml services

**Compute Resources**

- Virtual Machine
- Managed Kubernetes Clusters: make use of containers, which are good options when you need to run applications that depend on multiple microservices running in your env.
- Serverless Computing: developers and application admin to run their code in a computing env that does not require setting up VMs or Kubernetes clusters, by using App Engine, Cloud Run and Cloud Functions



**Storage**
- Object Storage : obj are grouped into buckets
- File Storage: provide hierarchical storage szstem for files
- Block Storage: uses fixed size data structure called block to organize data.  Block storage is commonly used in ephemeral and persistent disks attached to VMs
- Caches: In memory data stores that maintain fast access to data

**Networking**
 - Each network accessible device or servie in the env need an IP addresses
 - Define Firewall rules to control access to subnetworks and VMs in the VPC



## Cloud Computing v. Data Center Computing
     - Rent instead of own resources
     - Pay as you go
     - Elastic Resources Allocation
     - Specialized Services
